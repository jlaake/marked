Title: Mark-Recapture Analysis for Survival and Abundance Estimation
Author: Jeff Laake <jefflaake@gmail.com>, Devin Johnson
    <devin.johnson@noaa.gov>, Paul Conn <paul.conn@noaa.gov>, example for simHMM
    from Jay Rotella
Maintainer: Jeff Laake <jefflaake@gmail.com>
Description: Functions for fitting various models to capture-recapture data
    including mixed-effects Cormack-Jolly-Seber(CJS) and multistate models and
    the multi-variate state model structure for survival
    estimation and POPAN structured Jolly-Seber models for abundance estimation.
    There are also Hidden Markov model (HMM) implementations of CJS and multistate
    models with and without state uncertainty and a simulation capability for HMM
    models.

    R (>= 3.2.0),
    lme4,
    methods,
    parallel
Imports:
    graphics,
    stats,
    utils,
