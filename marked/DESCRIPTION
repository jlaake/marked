Description: Functions for fitting various models to capture-recapture data 
    including fixed and mixed-effects Cormack-Jolly-Seber(CJS) for survival estimation
    and POPAN structured Jolly-Seber models for abundance estimation. Includes a CJS models that concurrently estimates and corrects 
    for tag loss. Hidden Markov model (HMM) implementations of CJS and multistate models with and without state uncertainty.
