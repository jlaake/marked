  abstract      = {This article introduces Rcapture, an R package for capture-recapture
	experiments. The data for analysis consists of the frequencies of
	the observable capture histories over the t capture occasions of
	the experiment. A capture history is a vector of zeros and ones where
	one stands for a capture and zero for a miss. Rcapture can fit three
	types of models. With a closed population model, the goal of the
	analysis is to estimate the size N of the population which is assumed
	to be constant throughout the experiment. The estimator depends on
	the way in which the capture probabilities of the animals vary. Rcapture
	features several models for these capture probabilities that lead
	to different estimators for N. In an open population model, immigration
	and death occur between sampling periods. The estimation of survival
	rates is of primary interest. Rcapture can fit the basic Cormack-Jolly-Seber
	and Jolly-Seber model to such data. The third type of models fitted
	by Rcapture are robust design models. It features two levels of sampling;
	closed population models apply within primary periods and an open
	population model applies between periods. Most models in Rcapture
	have a loglinear form; they are fitted by carrying out a Poisson
	regression with the R function glm. Estimates of the demographic
	parameters of interest are derived from the loglinear parameter estimates;
	their variances are obtained by linearization. The novel feature
	of this package is the provision of several new options for modeling
	capture probabilities heterogeneity between animals in both closed
	population models and the primary periods of a robust design. It
	also implements many of the techniques developed by R. M. Cormack
	for open population models.},

  abstract      = {Summary. Live-trapping capture-recapture studies of animal populations
	with fixed trap locations inevitably have a spatial component: animals
	close to traps are more likely to be caught than those far away.
	This is not addressed in conventional closed-population estimates
	of abundance and without the spatial component, rigorous estimates
	of density cannot be obtained. We propose new, flexible capture-recapture
	models that use the capture locations to estimate animal locations
	and spatially referenced capture probability. The models are likelihood-based
	and hence allow use of Akaike's information criterion or other likelihood-based
	methods of model selection. Density is an explicit parameter, and
	the evaluation of its dependence on spatial or temporal covariates
	is therefore straightforward. Additional (nonspatial) variation in
	capture probability may be modeled as in conventional capture-recapture.
	The method is tested by simulation, using a model in which capture
	probability depends only on location relative to traps. Point estimators
	are found to be unbiased and standard error estimators almost unbiased.
	The method is used to estimate the density of Red-eyed Vireos (Vireo
	olivaceus) from mist-netting data from the Patuxent Research Refuge,
	Maryland, U.S.A. Estimates agree well with those from an existing
	spatially explicit method based on inverse prediction. A variety
	of additional spatially explicit models are fitted; these include
	models with temporal stratification, behavioral response, and heterogeneous
	animal home ranges.},

	and estimation of these unknown transition probabilities is the objective.
	We describe a computer routine for carrying out the analysis under
	a model that assumes Markovian transitions and under reduced-parameter
	versions of this model. We also introduce models that relax the Markovian
	assumption and allow "memory" to operate (i.e., allow dependence
	of the transition probabilities on the previous state). For these
	models, we suggest an analysis based on a conditional likelihood
	approach. Methods are illustrated with data from a large study on
	Canada geese (Branta canadensis) banded in three geographic regions.
	The assumption of Markovian transitions is rejected convincingly
	for these data, emphasizing the importance of the more general models
	that allow memory.},

	We used the Schwarz and Stobo model to estimate sighting, survival,
	recruitment, timing of births, abundance, and age-specific natality
	from sighting histories of 1,276 parous females. The advantage of
	this approach was that the reproductive status of females did not
	have to be known for all females of reproductive age. Probability
	of recruitment into the reproductive population began at age 3 or
	4, peaked between ages 5 and 7, and slowly declined. Age-specific
	natality was similar for ages 4–16 but declined after age 17, suggesting
	that reproductive senescence occurs in older females. The average
	annual natality for parous females 4–16 yr of age was 0.77 (SE
	= 0.03); natality declined to 0.56 (SE = 0.10) for parous females
	17–21 yr of age. Natality for both age classes was reduced during
	El Ni\~{n}o conditions by 24\% and 34\%, respectively. In addition
	to reducing natality, El Ni\~{n}o events may result in a delay of

	a flexible framework of likelihood-based models which allow for individual

	using finite mixtures, which have enough flexibility of distribution
	shape to accommodate a wide variety of different patterns of individual

	selection is done either using Akaike's information criterion or
	by likelihood ratio tests, making available checks of different influences
