Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Developing methods of marking animals that minimize or eliminate mark loss
 are important because mark-recapture estimators assume recaptures of marked
 individuals are always detected (Seber 1982).
 However, current methods of marking many different species indicate that
 problems with mark retention occur with small mammals (Fokidis et al.
 2006), large terrestrial mammals (Fosgate et al.
 2006), aquatic mammals (Bradshaw et al.
 2000), fish (Cowen and Schwartz 2006), and reptiles (Rivalan et al.
 2005).
 If the assumption that no marks are lost is violated then estimates of
 population parameters (e.g., survival and abundance) will be biased (Arnason
 and Mills 1981, Diefenbach and Alt 1998) because previously marked animals
 that lose all marks are treated as being part of the unmarked population
 in closed population models and as immigrants in open models.
 Furthermore, even if an estimator is robust to violation of this assumption,
 the loss of marks will reduce the precision of parameter estimates because
 of the apparent reduction in sample size (Rotella and Hines 2005).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Using natural markings to track individual animals can have low error rates
 (Stevick et al.
 2001), but not all species can be monitored in this manner.
 Consequently, methods of estimating tag loss likely will be necessary until
 new technologies are developed that eliminate mark loss.
 Historically, animals have been double-marked and the status of marks upon
 recapture (none or one mark missing) have been used to estimate mark loss
 under the assumption that each mark is lost independently of the other
 mark (Beverton and Holt 1957, Seber 1982).
 This independence assumption is required because the recapture of a marked
 animal that lost both marks is not observable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In recent studies where the opportunity has occurred to observe loss of
 both tags via the use of a third permanent mark, however, the independence
 assumption has been shown to be invalid (Siniff and Ralls, 1991; Diefenbach
 and Alt, 1998; Bradshaw, Barker and Davis, 2000; Rivalan et al., 2005; McMahon
 and White 2009).
 These studies undermine the credibility of tag loss evaluations for situations
 in which loss of both marks is not observable (Pistorius et al.
 2000).
 Consequently, it is important to incorporate appropriate models of mark
 loss to reduce bias in estimates of population parameters, even if modeling
 tag loss results in reduced precision (e.g., Pollock et al.
 2007).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Not all species can be easily given a permanent individually identifiable
 mark or doing so can be expensive in comparison to tagging.
 Thus, it makes sense to consider models which allow a sub-sample of individuals
 to be permanently marked.
 A variety of permanent marks including PIT tags(citations), hot brands
 (citations), or natural marks (citations) could be used depending on the
 recapture/resight method.
 We describe a modelling approach for tag loss that uses a sample of animals
 with a permanent mark to estimate tag loss for single tagging and to incorporat
e dependence in tag loss for double-tagging.
 We integrate the tag loss modelling into a Cormack-Jolly-Seber (CJS) framework
 using hidden Markov models to provide unbiased estimates of survival in
 the presence of tag loss.
 McMahon and White.
 (2009) developed a similar approach with multi-state modelling in MARK
 (White and Burnham 1990) but the specification of state transitions for
 tag loss were less direct than our model and required an unnecessary dummy
 parameter to specify independence.
 We apply our model which is available in the R package marked (Laake et
 al.
 2013) to capture-recapture data of black bears (
\shape italic
Ursus americanus
\shape default
) with two ear tags and a sample of bears given a separate permanent lip
 tatoo.

Single-Tag Loss CJS Models
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We start with the simpler situation in which each animal is only given a
 single tag but a subsample is also given a permanent individual mark.
 We define the indicator variable 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{M}$
\end_inset

 to be 1 if the animal has a permanent mark and 0 if not.
 The animals are released and then recaptured at a set of occasions as in
 a standard CJS framework.
 We will assume that recapture of animals does not depend on their tag status
 (e.g., animals are physically caught and then examined for marks).
 At each occasion, the released animal can be in any one of 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 = 3 states: 1) state 1 where animal is alive and has retained its tag,
 2) state 0 where the animal is alive but has lost its tag, and 3) state
 Dead where the animal is dead.
 An encounter history string for each animal is constructed using one of
 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

 = 3 values: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

+
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 when an animal is encountered alive with its tag, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

-
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 when a permanently marked animal is encountered without its tag, and 0
 for animals that are not encountered.
 We define 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

to be the probability of surviving the interval between occasions, 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 the probability of losing the tag during an interval, and 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 to be the probability of encountering a live animal.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Pradel (2005) proposed using hidden Markov models (HMM) for analysis of
 capture-recapture data.
 His work was followed by similar applications by Ford et al.
 (2012), Kendall et al.
 (2012), and Langrock and King (2013).
 We follow the HMM model specification described by Laake (2013) and implemented
 in the R package marked (Laake et al.
 2013).
 Following notation in Laake (2013), the state at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{t}$
\end_inset

 and the observation at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{t}$
\end_inset

.
 For this model, the states 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{t}$
\end_inset

 are 1 (alive with tag present), 0 (alive with tag missing) and dead.
 The observations 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{t}$
\end_inset

 are either + which means the tag was present, - when the tag was missing
 on a permanently marked animal and 0 means the animal was not seen.
 For animals without a permanent mark, the only possible observations are
 + and 0.
 A hidden Markov model is fully specified with two matrices: 1) 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma$
\end_inset

, the 
\begin_inset Formula $m\times m$
\end_inset

 one-step state transition probability matrix and 2) 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{D}$
\end_inset

 the 
\begin_inset Formula $s\times m$
\end_inset

 state-dependent observation probability matrix.
 The elements of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma$
\end_inset

 (Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:CJS Transition matrix-singletag"

\end_inset

),
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{ij}$
\end_inset

, are the probabilities of transitioning from state 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 to state 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

.
 The elements 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{ij}$
\end_inset

 of 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{D}$
\end_inset

 (Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:CJS Observation matrix-singletag"

\end_inset

) are 
\begin_inset Formula $Pr(X_{t}=i|C_{t}=j)$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $i=1,\ldots,\, s$
\end_inset

 is a sequential index for the observations and 
\begin_inset Formula $i=1,\ldots,\, m$
\end_inset

 is a state index.

Double-Tag Loss CJS Models
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If each an animal is given two tags and tags loss events are independent,
 then it is possible to estimate the probability that both tags are lost
 and the estimated survival can be corrected (ADD references).
 However, various researchers including (ADD references) have found that
 tag loss events are usually dependent and a model based on the independence
 assumption will underestimate double tag loss.
 If some of the animals have a permanent mark, double tag loss can be estimated
 directly and the model can allow for dependence in modelling the loss of
 tags of animals without a permanent mark.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With 2 tags, let 
\series bold
S
\series default
 
\begin_inset Formula $=$
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $S_{\mathrm{1}}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{\mathrm{2}})$
\end_inset

 represent the state vector of the status of the 2 tags where 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{i}$
\end_inset

 is a '1' if the 
\begin_inset Formula $i^{th}$
\end_inset

 tag is present and '0' if the 
\begin_inset Formula $i^{th}$
\end_inset

 tag is absent (lost) (note: this is counter to the convention of Diefenbach
 et al.
 (1998), Bradshaw et al.
 (2000) and Rivalan et al.
 (2005) who use 1 to denote a tag loss event).
 Usually the tagged animals can only be identified if one or more tags are
 retained and animals that have lost both tags (
\series bold
S
\series default
 
\begin_inset Formula $=$
\end_inset

 (0,0)) are not observable.
 However, with a sample of permanently marked animals, the '00' state is
 observable for those animals.
 Instead of assuming independence, we cast a model motivated by Bradshaw
 et al.
 (2000) with a parameter that controls whether tag loss is dependent or
 independent.
 We model the tag loss probability odds (logit link function) which enables
 use of covariates and dependence in tag fates.
 With dependence, the odds of losing a tag is dependent on the status of
 the other tag.
 The odds of losing the 
\begin_inset Formula $i^{th}$
\end_inset

 tag (
\begin_inset Formula $S_{i}=$
\end_inset

0) given the other tag is present (
\begin_inset Formula $S_{3-i\thinspace}=$
\end_inset

1) is 
\begin_inset Formula $e^{\beta_{i}}$
\end_inset

 and the odds of losing the 
\begin_inset Formula $i^{th}$
\end_inset

 tag (
\begin_inset Formula $S_{i}=$
\end_inset

0) given other tag is absent (
\begin_inset Formula $S_{3-i}=$
\end_inset

0) is 
\begin_inset Formula $e^{\beta_{i}+\beta_{3}}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{3}$
\end_inset

 determines the amount of dependence.
 These dependent odds are ratios of the joint probabilities (e.g., 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{01\thinspace}/\tau_{11\thinspace}\thinspace\textrm{and}\thinspace\tau_{00}/\tau_{10})$
\end_inset

 and not the marginal probabilities (Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:dep_table-logit"

\end_inset

).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With dependence conditional and marginal probabilities differ.
 We define 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{i}^{s_{3-i}}$
\end_inset

to be the conditional probability that the 
\begin_inset Formula $i^{th}$
\end_inset

 tag is lost given the other tag status is 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{3-i}$
\end_inset

: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\tau_{i}^{s_{3-i}}=Pr\left(S_{i}=0\vert S_{3-i}=s_{3-i}\right)=\frac{e^{\beta_{i}+\alpha(1-s_{3-i})}}{1+e^{\beta_{i}+\alpha(1-s_{3-i})}}\thinspace\thinspace.
\]

\end_inset

 Thus, 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{i}^{0}=Pr\left(S_{i}=0\vert S_{3-i}=0\right)=\frac{e^{\beta_{i}+\alpha}}{1+e^{\beta_{i}+\alpha}}$
\end_inset

 whereas, 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{i}^{1}=Pr\left(S_{i}=0\vert S_{3-i}=1\right)=\frac{e^{\beta_{i}}}{1+e^{\beta_{i}}}$
\end_inset

.
 The conditional probability of tag retention is 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{i}^{0}=1-\tau_{i}^{0}$
\end_inset

 and
\begin_inset Formula $\thinspace q_{i}^{1}=1-\tau_{i}^{1}$
\end_inset

 Each joint probability can be specified by the product of a marginal and
 a conditional probability: 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi_{11}=q_{1}^{1}q_{2}=q_{2}^{1}q_{1},\thinspace\thinspace\pi_{10}=q_{1}(1-q_{2}^{1})$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\thinspace\pi_{01}=q_{2}(1-q_{1}^{1}).$
\end_inset

 Likewise, the conditional probabilities can be computed from the ratio
 of the joint and marginal probabilities.
 The relationship between this model and dual observer mark-recapture distance
 sampling is described in the Appendix.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Diefenbach et al (1998) and Rivalan et al.
 (2005) specified the joint probabilities in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:dep_table-logit"

\end_inset

 in a slightly different manner with 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{01}=\tau_{10}=\tau(1-\tau^{\ast})$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{00}=\tau\tau^{\ast}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{11}=1-2\tau+\tau\tau^{\ast}$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 is the marginal tag loss probability and 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau^{\ast}$
\end_inset

 is the conditional probability of losing a tag given the other tag was
 absent.
 Although not stated, their conditional probability of losing a tag given
 the presence of the other tag would be 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau(1-\tau^{\ast})/(1-\tau)$
\end_inset

.
 In both papers the authors used separate functional forms for 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau*$
\end_inset

 and specified the independence model by using the same model for both (
\begin_inset Formula $\tau=\tau^{*})$
\end_inset

.
 Their approach is viable but we believe it is preferable to have a model
 with a parameter that controls dependence and with independence specified
 simply as 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha=$
\end_inset

0.
 Also, use of the logit-link allows covariates to be easily incorporated.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For doubly-tagged animals, the states for the HMM are 11,10,01,00 and Dead.
 The first four states describe the double tag status for live animals.
 The parameters for 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma$

 (Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

) are 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 for survival, and for tag loss, the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\beta}$
\end_inset

 which is used to compute the values for 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{1}^{0},\tau_{2}^{0}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{11},\tau_{01},\tau_{10},\tau_{00}$
\end_inset

.
 We define 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{i}=S_{i}$
\end_inset

 which are 1 when the 
\begin_inset Formula $i^{th}$
\end_inset

 tag is lost and 0 when not lost.
 With data for each of the four combinations of 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{2}$
\end_inset

 (00,01,10,11), a design matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 can be constructed with a formula using 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{i}$
\end_inset

 and to compute 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{11},\tau_{01},\tau_{10},\tau_{00}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{1}^{0},\tau_{2}^{0}$
\end_inset

 from those joint probabilities.
 For example, using R formula notation 
\begin_inset Formula $~t_{1}+t_{2}+t_{1}:t_{2}$
\end_inset

 produces 
\begin_inset Formula $X=\left[\begin{array}{ccc}
0 & 0 & 0\\
0 & 1 & 0\\
1 & 0 & 0\\
1 & 1 & 1
\end{array}\right]$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\exp(X\beta)/(1'\exp(X\beta))$
\end_inset

 produces the joint probabilities shown in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

where 1' is a row vector of ones and 
\begin_inset Formula $K=1'\exp(X\beta)$
\end_inset

.
 The formula
\begin_inset Formula $~t_{1}+t_{2}$
\end_inset

 produces a model based on independence with loss rates varying by tag and
 
\begin_inset Formula $~I(t_{1}+t_{2})$
\end_inset

 is the indepedence model with equal tag loss rates.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The observations are specified as ++,+-,-+,-- and 00.
 The + indicates the tag was present for an animal that was observed alive
 and a - means the tag was missing.
 The observation 00 means the animal was not seen on the occasion.
 We assume if an animal was seen, the correct status was observed for each
 tag.
 Thus, no errors or partial observations are allowed.
 The parameters for D are capture probabilities

Hidden Markov model observation probability matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{D}$

 for a Cormack-Jolly-Seber model with singly-tagged animals and a sample
 with a permanent mark.
 Capture is independent of the tag status which is known with certainty.
 The observations 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{t}$
\end_inset

 are either + which means the tag was present, - when the tag was missing
 on a permanently marked animal and 0 means the animal was not seen.
 The indicator variable 
\size small

\begin_inset Formula $I_{M}$
\end_inset


\size default
 is 1 for permanently marked animals and 0 otherwise.
 The columns sum to 1 for this matrix.

Hidden Markov model observation matrix for a Cormack-Jolly-Seber model in
 which capture is independent of the tags and tag status is known with certainty.
 Alive states are 11,10,01, and 00 which represent the status of the tags.
 For observations, + means the tag was present when recaptured, - means
 the tag was missing on an animal that was recaptured and 00 means the animal
 was not recaptured.
 The indicator variable 
\size small

\size default
 is 1 for permanently marked animals and 0 otherwise.
 For animals without a permanent mark, the observation will always be 00
 for state 00 and is thus not separable from the dead state.

\begin_layout Standard
The probability structure for tag loss is equivalent to capture-recapture
 (mark-recapture) for two occasions with a closed population which has been
 used with two observers to measure detection probability in visual surveys.
 When detection probability is measured solely with the mark-recapture data,
 it is necessary to assume independence between the detections by the two
 observers because those missed by both observers (
\begin_inset Formula $n_{00})$
\end_inset

 are obviously not included in the sample (Borchers, 1999).
 Recently, the independence assumption was weakened (Laake, 1999; Laake
 and Borchers 2004; Borchers et al., 2006) in the combined mark-recapture
 and distance sampling by including a dependence measure 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta(x)$
\end_inset

 which was estimated as the discrepancy between the detection probability
 at distance 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 measured by the mark-recapture (double observer) data (based on independence)
 and the distance sampling data.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta(x)=$
\end_inset

1 then independence at all distances is achieved.
 Because detection probability at 
\begin_inset Formula $x=$
\end_inset

0 cannot be measured from the distance sampling data, the independence assumptio
n for the mark-recapture data was required for 
\begin_inset Formula $x=$
\end_inset

0 (
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

(

)
\begin_inset Formula $=$
\end_inset

1) but not for the other distances.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The dependence structure we have defined for tag loss can be expressed in
 terms of the 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

 dependence of Borchers et al.
 (2006).
 Under the independence model, the probability that an animal would retain
 at least one tag is: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
1-\pi_{00}^{\ast}=\frac{1+e^{\beta_{1}}+e^{\beta_{2}}}{1+e^{\beta_{1}}+e^{\beta_{2}}+e^{\beta_{1}+\beta_{2}}}
\]

\end_inset

 Likewise for the dependence model (Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:dep_table-logit"

\end_inset

): 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
1-\pi_{00}=\frac{1+e^{\beta_{1}}+e^{\beta_{2}}}{1+e^{\beta_{1}}+e^{\beta_{2}}+e^{\beta_{1}+\beta_{2}+\alpha}}
\]

\end_inset

 The dependence of Borchers et al.
 (2006) is a ratio that measures the distortion between the joint probabilities
 from the independence model (Table 2) and the dependence model (Table 3)
 which can be expressed as: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\delta=\frac{1-\pi_{00}^{\ast}}{1-\pi_{00}}=\frac{K}{K^{\ast}}=1+\frac{e^{\beta_{1}+\beta_{2}}(e^{\alpha}-1)}{1+e^{\beta_{1}+\beta_{2}}+e^{\beta_{1}}+e^{\beta_{2}}}=1+(e^{\alpha}-1)\pi_{00}^{\ast}
\]

\end_inset

 The same relationship is obtained from 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta=q_{i}^{1}/q_{i}=\frac{K}{K^{\ast}}\thinspace$
\end_inset

and from the ratio of any of the joint probabilities other than for the
 (0,0) event which is not used in the independence model.
 The dependence measure can also be expressed in terms of covariance (Borchers
 1999) which in this case can be expressed as: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\delta=1+\frac{\mathrm{cov}(S_{1},S_{2})}{q_{1}q_{2}}=1+\frac{\frac{1}{K}-q_{1}q_{2}}{q_{1}q_{2}}=\frac{\frac{1}{K}}{\frac{K^{\ast}}{K^{2}}}=1+(e^{\alpha}-1)\pi_{00}^{\ast}
\]

\end_inset

 In general there will likely be positive dependence in tag loss which means
 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset


\begin_inset ERT

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The joint probabilities can be rewritten in terms of 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

 as: 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi_{11}=\delta q_{1}q_{2},\thinspace\thinspace\pi_{10}=q_{1}(1-\delta q_{2})$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\thinspace\pi_{01}=q_{2}\left(1-\delta q_{1}\right)$
\end_inset

 or as 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi_{11}=q_{1}^{1}q_{2}^{1}/\delta,\thinspace\thinspace\pi_{10}=q_{1}^{1}\tau_{2}^{1}/\delta$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi_{01}=q_{2}^{1}\tau_{1}^{1}/\delta$
\end_inset

.
 The latter form makes it obvious that once you exclude 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{00}$
\end_inset

 and condition on the observed data, the 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

 will cancel from the rescaled joint probabilities which will only be functions
 of the 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{i}^{1}$
\end_inset

.
 This is also obvious by examining Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:dep_table-logit"

\end_inset

 and noting that the joint probabilities for the observed set of data (
\begin_inset Formula $n_{11}n_{10}n_{01})$
\end_inset

 would only be functions of 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{i}$
\end_inset

 after conditioning on the exclusion of 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{00}$
\end_inset

.
 The same result was shown by Borchers et al.
 (2006) for mark-recapture distance sampling (mrds) but in that case 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

 could be estimated from the observed distances.
 For tag loss estimation, there is no equivalent ancillary data; however,
 there are various ways that dependence can be incorporated to improve tag
 loss estimation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Unfortunately, there is no equivalent ancillary data for tag loss models
 as in mark-recapture distance sampling.
 One could envision models that could incorporate dependence only from doubly-ta
gged individuals.
 For example, consider California sea lions (
\shape italic
Zalophus californinanus
\shape default
) which have a tag applied to both fore-flippers as pups.
 Initially, tag loss may be due to manufacturing or application defects
 which may be independent between tags; however, as the animal grows, the
 expansion of the fore-flipper may put pressure on the tag causing the tag
 to split or may cause tissue damage that allows the tag to fall out.
 Because growth is symmetric, if one tag is lost the other is also more
 likely to be lost.
 Thus, we could propose a model in which 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha=$
\end_inset

0 initially for a few years but not subsequent years.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{i}$
\end_inset

 are age-invariant or can be expressed as a linear function on age, then
 the slope and intercept for tag loss could be estimated during the period
 in which 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha=$
\end_inset

0 and deviations from this pattern would be measured as dependence.
 However, this approach would be very model-dependent with no good way to
 evaluate the model reliability.
 Thus, we recommend using a permanently marked sample.
